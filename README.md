Our areas of interest were the following:
Year
Country
GDP

We used the following datasets:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?end=1990&start=1990&view=bar
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?end=1990&start=1990&view=bar

Reviwed the files and transformed into data frames.
Removed the first 4 rows.(cleaning the data)
Merged the two datasets
